# ASYNCHRONOUS COMPREHENSIONS

This project folder contains tasks aimed at achieving the following learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external references:

1. **How to write an asynchronous generator**
   
   An asynchronous generator is a special type of generator that allows for asynchronous iteration. It is defined using the `async def` syntax and uses the `yield` statement to produce values. You will learn how to define and use asynchronous generators effectively.

2. **How to use async comprehensions**

   Async comprehensions are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to create asynchronous generators and collect the produced values in a convenient way. You will explore how to use async comprehensions to simplify your code when working with asynchronous data streams.

3. **How to type-annotate generators**

   Type annotations are a powerful tool for adding static typing information to your Python code. You will learn how to apply type annotations to generators, including asynchronous generators, to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Tasks

To achieve the above learning objectives, the project tasks are as follows:

1. **Task 1: Writing an Asynchronous Generator**
   
   In this task, you will create a Python module named `async_generator.py` and implement an asynchronous generator function. The function should yield a series of values asynchronously, demonstrating the usage of `yield` within an asynchronous context.

2. **Task 2: Using Async Comprehensions**
   
   In this task, you will create a new Python file named `async_comprehensions.py`. Inside this file, you will demonstrate the use of async comprehensions by creating an asynchronous generator that produces a series of values based on a given condition. Then, you will collect and process these values using an async comprehension.

3. **Task 3: Type-annotating Generators**
   
   In this task, you will create a Python file named `type_annotated_generators.py`. Within this file, you will define a generator function and an asynchronous generator function, both of which will be type-annotated using appropriate annotations. You will explore different aspects of type annotations for generators and asynchronous generators.

Feel free to explore the provided tasks in any order you prefer. Each task will help you build a deeper understanding of the respective learning objectives.

Happy learning!
